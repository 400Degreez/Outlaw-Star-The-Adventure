        <h1>Our crew decides to confront the hostile group of space piartes to see what their problem is.</h1>
        <p>Approching the pirates calmly, the pirates seem to tense up. Our leader Jean asks them "Is their a problem"? They respond with "YEA!!!!,you guys stole our bounty last year!!" The crew is confused as they look at eachother. Jean asks "How much was the bounty"? The pirates respond with " $16,000 double dollars!!!". Jean then reaches into his pocket and pulls out the money. He looks at the pirates with a smile and says"Here,take it. Sorry bout that." The space pirates are confused by Jeans kindness, as our crew begins to head for the exit. The pirates yell " HEY WAIT!!!!". Jean turns around and asks "what?". The pirates respond with "You guys want a drink?". Jean nods and both crews begin to laugh and joke about the situation. The turns lively again as our crew enjoy their night.</p>
