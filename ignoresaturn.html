        <h1>Our crew decides to ignore the rowdy bunch but they can still sense some hostility </h1>
        <p>Our crew sits down and orders a round of drinks for everyone ignoring the rowdy bunch.The space pirates seem annoyed by this and one of the members decides to walk over to our crew.He confronts our leader Jean with a stare, then he punches him square in his face. Jean responds with a thunderous kick that sends the pirate flying. The other space pirates are scared stiff as Jean stares at them. They pick up their comradeand quickly head for the door. The entire bar seems releived by this as the energy shifts to a happier mood. Jean sits back down with his comrades and relaxes as the crew begins to joke and laugh about what just happened.</p>
